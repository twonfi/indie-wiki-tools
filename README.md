# Indie Wiki Tools
Python scripts for helping with Indie Wiki Buddy. They are "quick and dirty", meaning it's not the best code, but it
works.

* `special-stats-table-gen`: Create Special:Statistics tables (compare wikis)
* `non-indie-wiki-finder`: Generate Google search queries to find non-indie wikis
