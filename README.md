# Indie Wiki Tools
"Quick and dirty" Python scripts for helping with Indie Wiki Buddy.
* `special-stats-table-gen`: Create Special:Statistics tables (compare wikis)
* `non-indie-wiki-finder`: Generate Google search queries to find non-indie wikis

(Code was written in a rush, so not the best, but does work)
